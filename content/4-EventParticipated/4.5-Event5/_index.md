# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3"

### Event Objectives

The event aimed to explore AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices, focusing on security principles, role-based access control, Single Sign-On (SSO), AWS Organizations, credential management, and advanced IAM features for enterprise security.

### Speakers

1. **Huỳnh Hoàng Long**

2. **Đinh Lê Hoàng Anh**

### Key Highlights

#### Understanding IAM (Identity and Access Management)

**Definition:**

- IAM consists of roles with specific permissions assigned to specific users

- Increases authentication capabilities for the system

- Provides fine-grained access control to AWS resources

**Core Concept:**

- Roles define what actions can be performed

- Users are assigned roles based on their responsibilities

- Enhances system security through proper access management

#### IAM Best Practices

**1. Principle of Least Privilege:**

- Best practice: Do not grant an account too many permissions

- Only grant specific permissions needed for the task

- Reduces security risks and potential damage from compromised accounts

**2. Root Access Key Management:**

- **Delete root access keys** because they have the highest privileges

- If access keys are lost, it won't cause too much impact

- Minimizes maximum potential losses

- Root account should only be used for initial setup and emergency scenarios

**3. Avoid Wildcard Permissions:**

- Avoid using `*` (asterisk) which means full permissions for all services

- Use specific service and action permissions instead

- Provides better security and auditability

**4. Use AWS Login (Temporary Credentials):**

- Should use AWS login because it resets at least every 15 minutes and at most every 36 hours

- Increases security significantly

- Temporary credentials reduce the risk of long-term exposure

- Automatically expires, reducing attack surface

**5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**

- MFA is an additional authentication step that helps prevent unauthorized access

- Prevents account login from other locations

- Adds an extra layer of security beyond passwords

- Should be enabled for all privileged accounts

**6. Regular Password Changes:**

- Should regularly change account passwords

- Follows security best practices for credential management

- Reduces risk of compromised credentials

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

**Definition:**

- SSO allows one login to access multiple systems

- Users authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications

- When switching to another app, no need to login again

**Enterprise Benefits:**

- Better management in enterprise environments

- Multiple roles available, each with specific accounts

- Centralized access control

- Simplified user experience

**AWS Integration:**

- When activating SSO, simultaneously activates AWS Organizations

- Enables centralized management of multiple AWS accounts

- Provides unified access control across the organization

#### AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCP)

**AWS Organizations:**

- Enables management of multiple AWS accounts from a central location

- Provides consolidated billing and account management

- Works in conjunction with SSO for enterprise access control

**Service Control Policies (SCP):**

- Service control policies that can set maximum permission limits within an account

- Provides centralized security governance

- Can restrict what actions can be performed across accounts

- Helps enforce organizational security policies

#### Permission Boundaries

**Definition:**

- An advanced IAM service that handles centralized security issues

- Sets the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant

- Provides an additional layer of security control

- Prevents privilege escalation even if policies are misconfigured

**Use Cases:**

- Delegating permissions to developers or teams

- Ensuring users cannot exceed intended permissions

- Centralized security management in large organizations

#### Credential Spectrum and Rotation

**Credential Spectrum:**

- Understanding different types of credentials and their security implications

- From long-term access keys to temporary credentials

- Balancing security with usability

**Credential Rotation:**

- About AWS Secrets Manager service

- Process: Create fake accounts with new passwords, test if they can be used, apply to your account, and finally delete old accounts

- Automates the rotation of database credentials, API keys, and other secrets

- Reduces risk of credential compromise

- Ensures credentials are regularly updated without manual intervention

**AWS Secrets Manager Benefits:**

- Automatic rotation of secrets

- Secure storage of credentials

- Integration with AWS services

- Audit trail of secret access

#### IAM Access Analyzer

**Overview:**

- Tool for analyzing IAM policies and access patterns

- Identifies resources shared with external entities

- Helps discover unintended access

- Provides recommendations for improving security posture

**Key Features:**

- Analyzes resource-based policies

- Identifies publicly accessible resources

- Suggests policy improvements

- Continuous monitoring of access patterns

**Policy Analysis:**

- Detects policies containing `Principal: *` (public access)

- Flags security issues even when conditions are present

- Helps identify and remediate security risks

**Automated Remediation:**

- Can integrate with EventBridge for automated responses

- Lambda functions can add deny statements to IAM roles

- SNS notifications for security team alerts

- Enables proactive security management

### Key Takeaways

1. **IAM Fundamentals:**

   - IAM roles and users provide granular access control

   - Proper IAM configuration is essential for AWS security

   - Authentication and authorization are separate but related concepts

2. **Security Best Practices:**

   - Follow principle of least privilege

   - Delete root access keys

   - Avoid wildcard permissions

   - Use temporary credentials (AWS login)

   - Enable MFA for all accounts

   - Regularly rotate passwords

3. **Enterprise Access Management:**

   - SSO simplifies access across multiple systems

   - AWS Organizations enables centralized account management

   - SCPs provide organization-wide security governance

   - Permission boundaries prevent privilege escalation

4. **Credential Management:**

   - Use AWS Secrets Manager for credential rotation

   - Prefer temporary credentials over long-term access keys

   - Automate credential rotation where possible

   - Monitor credential usage and access patterns

5. **Continuous Security:**

   - Use IAM Access Analyzer for ongoing security assessment

   - Regularly review and audit IAM policies

   - Monitor for unintended access

   - Stay updated with AWS security best practices

### Applying to Work
