### Week 2 Achievements:

- Gained clear understanding of Security Groups and NACL:

  - Security Groups are stateful firewalls that only allow "allow" rules
  - NACL is a stateless firewall applied to subnets
  - Security Groups affect individual instances, NACL affects multiple servers in a subnet

- Learned how to use VPC Flow Logs to monitor IP traffic in VPC without capturing packet contents.

- Understood VPC connection methods:

  - VPC Peering to connect 2 VPCs, does not support transitive routing
  - Transit Gateway to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks
  - Site-to-Site VPN with Virtual Private Gateway and Customer Gateway
  - AWS Direct Connect with low latency (20-30ms)

- Mastered knowledge of Elastic Load Balancing:

  - 4 types: ALB, NLB, Classic LB, Gateway LB
  - ALB operates at Layer 7, supports HTTP/HTTPS and path-based routing
  - NLB operates at Layer 4, supports TCP/TLS and static IP
  - Features: Health Check, Sticky Session, Access Logs

- Successfully completed hands-on practice:

  - Created Security Groups for EC2 with appropriate rules
  - Configured NACL for subnet with logical rule ordering
  - Set up Application Load Balancer with Target Groups
  - Verified Load Balancer operation and traffic distribution

- Gained ability to compare and select appropriate security solutions and network connectivity for specific use cases.
