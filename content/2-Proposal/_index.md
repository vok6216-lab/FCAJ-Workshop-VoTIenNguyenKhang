# Enterprise HR Management System

## Comprehensive HR Management Solution for Modern Enterprises

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Enterprise HR Management System** is an integrated HR management solution designed for mid-sized enterprises in Vietnam, supporting **100-500 employees**. The system automates the entire HR workflow from profile management, attendance tracking, payroll calculation to performance evaluation. This is an **in-house project** developed by the team, focusing on **MVP with optimized costs under $100/month** in the initial phase (100 employees), utilizing **AWS serverless architecture** with Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB to ensure high performance and low costs.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Issues

- Vietnamese enterprises use **Excel** or legacy HR software, causing time waste and errors.
- Manual processes (attendance, payroll) are **not integrated**.
- No **automated approval workflows**.
- Difficult to manage **detailed permissions**.
- Weak reporting, **not real-time**.
- High costs for SAP, Workday solutions.

### Proposed Solution

The system uses **AWS Serverless Architecture** to optimize costs:

- **Compute:** AWS Lambda (pay-per-use, no idle costs).
- **API:** API Gateway REST API.
- **Database:** DynamoDB (on-demand billing).
- **Cache:** ElastiCache Redis (cache.t3.micro) - optional for phase 2.
- **Authentication:** **AWS Cognito** (free tier <50K MAU).
- **Storage:** S3 for documents, CloudFront CDN.
- **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment.
- **Monitoring:** **CloudWatch** (free tier).
- **Security:** Route 53, WAF (cost-optimized rules), IAM Roles.

### Key Features

- **Single Sign-On** (Google, Microsoft 365).
- **Detailed RBAC** (Admin, Manager, Employee, Payroll Officer).
- **Check-in/out with GPS validation**.
- **Automated payroll calculation** with flexible formulas.
- **Approval workflows** (leave, salary adjustment).
- **Mobile app** (React Native) for attendance.
- **Real-time reporting dashboard**.
- Comprehensive audit logs.

### Benefits

- Save **70%** of manual HR processing time.
- Reduce **90%** of data entry errors.
- Cost only **$45-70/month** for 100 employees (90% cheaper than SAP/Workday).
- **In-house development** - no outsourcing costs.

## 7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk                    | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                                            |
| :---------------------- | :----- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| DynamoDB costs spike    | Medium | Low         | On-demand billing, CloudWatch alarms at $30 threshold |
| Lambda cold starts      | Low    | Medium      | Keep functions warm, optimize bundle size <1MB        |
| API Gateway rate limits | Medium | Low         | Default 10K req/s sufficient, implement caching       |
| Vendor lock-in (AWS)    | Medium | High        | Use Serverless Framework for portability              |
| Team learning curve     | Low    | Medium      | Start with 1-2 Lambda functions, expand gradually     |

### Cost Optimization Best Practices

- **Lambda:** Bundle size <1MB, reuse connections, avoid cold starts.
- **DynamoDB:** Single-table design, use GSIs carefully, on-demand billing.
- **S3:** Lifecycle policies to Glacier, presigned URLs, CloudFront caching.
- **API Gateway:** Response caching (30-60s), throttling.
- **CloudWatch:** Log retention 7 days, filter unnecessary logs.
